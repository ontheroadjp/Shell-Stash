# Shell Stash

This script provides a temporary file or directory stash in the shell.
Files or directories can be moved in and out of this stash from any directory.

## What's usuful ?

If you install Shell-Stash, you don't need to specify long paths and use mv and cp commands.

If you use mv or cp commands in the shell, instead of using them, you can simply put them in stash, move the directory, and then immediately remove them from stash.

However, if you use the cd command every time you want to move a directory, Shell-Stash may not be as effective as you think.

In that case, you may want to prepare the environment for directory movement first.
